# Ushahidi v3.x User Experience Research



[User Experience design](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/05/what-
is-user-experience-design-overview-tools-and-resources/) is about
understanding the interactions between a system and its users, and how the
system fits the users' expected behaviours and needs.

The Ushahidi team collaborated with Gabriel White of[Small
Surfaces](http://smallsurfaces.com/)to collect community input and build the
user experience (UX) strategy for [Ushahidi Platform
v3.x](/display/WIKI/Ushahidi+Platform+v3.x). These designs have been
incorporated into the V3 wireframes, and are being built into the V3 platform.

Here are the V3 user experience design worksheets:
