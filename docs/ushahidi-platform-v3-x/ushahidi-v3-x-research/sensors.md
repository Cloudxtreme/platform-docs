# Sensors



Ushahidi v3.X is designed to include sensor feeds. To see how people might use
these, the Ushahidi team have been:

  * talking to the [Brck](/display/WIKI/BRCK) team about feeds from Brck to Ushahidi,
  * looking at available sensors and sensor types,
  * looking at online sensor datastores (and how to access them),
  * looking at sensors in the equipment around us (e.g. laptops and mobile phones)
  * checking out work on sensor feeds in other communities,
  * working on how to present sensor data in Ushahidi v3.x
  * [blogging about sensor ideas](http://blog.ushahidi.com/2014/03/05/crowdsourcing-internet-of-things-sensors/)
