# Installing Ushahidi 3.x on Mac OS



Props to Woody for hand-holding and instructions on this.

There are 3 main ways to install Ushahidi 3.x on Mac OS:

  * Using Vagrantvirtual machine
  * Using [Homebrew to install mysql and run Ushahidi natively](/display/WIKI/Configuring+Apache%2C+PHP%2C+and+MySQL+Using+Homebrew)
  * Use [Mamp](/display/WIKI/Installing+Ushahidi+3.x+on+OSX+with+MAMP+Pro)

Vagrant is generally recommended for Ushahidi 3.x because it allows you to
isolate your environment, and you don't have to manage a *AMP (Apache-Mysql-
Php) stack on your Mac. Homebrew is recommended over Vagrant if you're going
to develop other websites locally on your Mac. Mamp is last on the list of
recommendations.
